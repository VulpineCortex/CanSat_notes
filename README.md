# CanSat_notes
place for all things CanSat, we'll start off using only the project page but in later stages it would be beneficial to make use of the versioning system and text files. We can still use things like google docs during meetings (when live collaboration is required) but it's rarely needed. We can use formats such as LaTeX and Markdown.
